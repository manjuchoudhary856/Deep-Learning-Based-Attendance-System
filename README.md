Real-time Attendance System Using Deep-learning Face Recognition:
This project showcases a robust real-time attendance system leveraging deep learning and face recognition to streamline and secure attendance tracking. Built using FaceNet and a 128-dimensional encoding technique, the system accurately identifies students and automates attendance marking by comparing live captures with a stored database of faces.

Key Highlights:
Efficiency: Eliminates the need for manual attendance, saving time and reducing errors.
Accuracy: Uses FaceNetâ€™s deep learning model to achieve reliable face matching.
Security: Minimizes proxy attendance and ensures authenticity through face recognition.
Practical Application: Designed for classroom or organizational use, with scalability for large groups.
